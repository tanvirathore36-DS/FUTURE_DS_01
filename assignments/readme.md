# Assignment Folder

This folder contains the Power BI dashboard file created for the internship Task-1 project.

## Contents

- (Optional) Any supporting files specific to this assignment.

## How to Use
- Open `dashboard.pbix` using **Power BI Desktop** (version 2.1 or later).
- Ensure the required data files are available in the repository’s `data/` folder.
- If the data source connection breaks, re-link the CSV files by going to **Home > Transform Data > Data Source Settings** in Power BI.

## Notes
- The dashboard includes visualizations for **total sales, order volume, top products, yearly sales distribution, and country-wise performance**.
- For a quick preview without Power BI, see the screenshots in the `../screenshots/` folder.
