# Project Report — Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my internship assignment. The goal was to analyze sales and profit data, build meaningful visualizations, and design an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

## Objectives
- Transform and analyze raw sales data.
- Create visuals to highlight sales trends, profit margins, and country-wise performance.
- Design a dashboard with a clean and professional layout for better decision-making.

## Deliverables
- **Power BI Dashboard (`assignment/dashboard.pbix`)** — fully interactive report.
- **Screenshots (`screenshots/`)** — exported views of the dashboard for quick reference.
- **Data (`data/`)** — source files used for analysis.
- **Documentation (`README.md` files)** — explanations for each folder and overall project.

## Key Insights
- Identified the top profit-making brand and high-performing regions.
- Highlighted states with the best profit margins.
- Calculated adjusted revenue considering promotional rebates.
- Analyzed order volume distribution to flag low-volume transactions.

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of sales and profit performance. It demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through visualization and storytelling in Power BI.
